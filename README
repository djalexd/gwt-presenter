If you're looking for a simple, non-intrusive and intuitive Presenter implementation of MVP,
you've found it. This is all you need to do:

In your .gwt.xml file:
<code><inherits name="com.questdome.gwt.presenter.GwtPresenter"/></code>

In your code:
 * code your view:
 
 interface/class SimpleView extends IsWidget {
   // operations
 }
 
 interface/class SimplePresenter extends Presenter<SimpleView> {
   // operations. The presenter can access its bound display through
   // #getDisplay() method.
 }
